          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>

          <h3>Health perspectives</h3>
          <p>Many researchers had studied the perverse relationship between poverty and health. These studies had been 
          conducted at country level and within different kinds of countries. Indeed, it is pointed out that equity in 
          income is related with equity in health. <a href=" https://www.scielosp.org/article/bwho/2003.v81n7/539-545/" > Paula BravemanI and Sofia GruskinII </a> 
          point out that equity in health reflects a concern to reduce unequal opportunities to be healthy associated 
          with membership in less privileged social groups, such as poor people; disenfranchised racial, ethnic or
          religious groups; women; and rural residents. In operational terms, pursuing equity in health means eliminating 
          health disparities that are systematically associated with underlying social disadvantage or marginalization. 
          An equity framework systematically focuses attention on socially disadvantaged, marginalized, or disenfranchised
          groups within and between countries, including but not limited to the poor.</p>

          <p>About income and assets <a href = â€œhttps://www.scielosp.org/article/bwho/2002.v80n2/97-105/en/> Adam Wagstaff </a> 
          noticed that income and assets inequalities vary widely by country, and are a key component of household resources. 
          In developing countries under otherwise constant conditions, higher income is associated with more frequent and more 
          intensive use of health services in both the private and public sectors; the use of modern health care providers 
          rather than traditional practitioners; and the number of children a woman has and the age at which she has her first 
          child. Most dietary and child-feeding practices also improve with higher levels of income, as do sanitary practices. 
          The human assets of knowledge, literacy, and education, whose levels tend to be lower among the poor, also influence
          household decisions with regard to the proximate determinants of health. Education, especially that of women, is 
          strongly associated with many behaviours and choices that are conducive to good health, even after controlling for income. 
          It is not just the levels of these variables that matter, but also their distribution within the household, especially 
          between men and women. A low level of control over household resources by women, which seems especially likely in poor 
          households, often harms health outcomes for them and their families.</p>

          <h3>Some national observations </h3>

          <p>Practical experience suggests that eliminating systematic health disparities between social groups requires correcting their 
          fundamental causes, at least to some extent, as well as cushioning their health-damaging effects. Furthermore, a commitment to 
          equalizing opportunities to be healthy inherently requires identification of the determinants as well as manifestations of
          health disparities. Concern for health equity thus implies a values-based commitment to tackle poverty and health, with or without 
          conclusive evidence of aggregate utilitarian gains.</p>

          <p>In the graph above it is observed that there is a linear tendency that shows that the grater the percentage of people in poverty 
          the greater lack of healthcare.  There is a case that outstands th rest of the states. This case is Texas that has a 14 percent of people 
          in poverty but has the biggest amount of people without healthcare assistance. This might be reflected in high levels of smoking 
          and obesity. As mentioned before, the more assistance and less poverty, the more is likely to have healthy population, since people 
          tend to be more responsible with their health. It could be observed that the poorer the population the more obese and
          and smoking percentages.</p>
