# D3-challenge
This is the repository for the D3 Homework - Data Journalism and D3

This repository includes two folders. The one called D3_data_journalism includes a basic graph done in d3 where it is compared the percentage of population that lack of healthcare *vs* percentage of population in poverty. This graph is done following suggestions in the pages [Scatterplot with tooltip in d3.js]( https://www.d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/scatter_tooltip.html
) and [Scatterplot of Text Labels](https://observablehq.com/@abebrath/scatterplot-of-text-labels)
In this case it is not used the d3.tip function. The resulting graph is presented in the next figure.

It is observed that there is a *linear* relationship between both variables, *i.e.*, it is observed that the states with a bigger percentage of poor people has a bigger percentage of people without healthcare, which is reflected in higher levels of smoking and obesity.

The second folder is called D3_data_jounalism_b1 and includes the bonus challenge, but onlu considering two x axis and two y axis. There are two app javascript files. The one called app.js contains the script to generate a graph with two x axis, while in app2.js it is included the code for a graph with two y axis and two x axis. In both cases, the d3.tip function is used. The resulting page is shown below.

The graph shows the same relationships between poverty and lack of health services, and bad habits (smoking and obesity).
